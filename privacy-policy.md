## 1. Overview

Vehicle Diagnosis AI (“the App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, processed, and protected when you use the App.

The App does not require account registration and does not collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.

## 2. Information We Process

The App processes the following types of information:

### a) User-Provided Content
- Text entered by users for vehicle diagnosis or repair guidance.
- Images voluntarily uploaded by users for issue identification.

This information is transmitted securely to a third-party AI service provider (OpenAI) for processing and response generation.

### b) Analytics Data
The App uses **Firebase Analytics** to collect anonymized usage data. This may include:
- Device type
- Operating system version
- App interaction events
- Crash diagnostics
- Performance metrics

This data helps improve app stability, usability, and performance.

Firebase Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name or email unless you voluntarily provide it (which this app does not request).

## 3. How Information Is Used

Information is used strictly for:
- Providing AI-powered vehicle diagnosis responses
- Generating repair guidance
- Improving app performance and reliability
- Monitoring crashes and technical issues
- Enhancing user experience

We do not sell, rent, or trade user information.

## 4. Data Storage

- Diagnosis history is stored locally on your device.
- If you uninstall the app, locally stored data is permanently deleted.
- We do not maintain a cloud-based user account database.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The App relies on the following third-party services:

### OpenAI
User-submitted text and images are securely transmitted to OpenAI for AI response generation. OpenAI processes this data according to its own privacy and data usage policies.

### Google Firebase

Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these third-party providers.

## 6. Data Security

All data transmissions are encrypted using secure HTTPS protocols. We take reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect information during transmission.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed toward children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
